BlightScript: A Windows Desktop Interaction Demo

Overview

Blight is a Python-based proof-of-concept application designed to demonstrate advanced desktop interaction techniques on Windows systems. It showcases the use of GUI manipulation, audio playback, browser automation, and keyboard input detection to create an immersive user experience. This project is intended for educational purposes, such as learning about system-level programming, GUI automation, and process management in Python. It is not intended for malicious use, and users are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and ethical guidelines.

Platform: Windows only (due to reliance on winsound and ctypes for system interactions).
